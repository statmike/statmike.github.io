overview for my memory:
for a post, add the tags: to the top of each post
create _includes/tags.html
  this is a liquid script that creates site.tags
%include tags.html in the head block
  this is in _layouts/default.html
  near the google analytics include
edit the layout for post to include tags in _layouts/post.html
  [??] make this pretty - shows up on any single blog post in the header
create a tag page as _layouts/tagpage.html
  [??] make this pretty - creates a page when you click a tag in a blog post header or the tag cloud on the main blog page
build tag pages
  create a folder for this as /tag
  create markdown file for each tag here: like types-of-computing.md
create the tag cloud
  create _includes/tagcloud.html
  add this to the main blog landing page blog/index.html
  [??] make this pretty
