I setup the site to use google analytics

view the site changes in this commit:
https://github.com/statmike/statmike.github.io/commit/293efec7c8abc7097e711362322f4ba2db0cb577

the rest of the setup was done in google analytics where I got the code snippet in
_includes/googleanalytics.html

which I edited to call the variable {{site.google_analytics}}

which I stored in _config.yml as the value

The %include is placed in the head for my site which is in
_layouts/default.html

  on most sites this is in _includes/head.html or header.html
  but in my case this file is for a <header> block which is repeated multiple time on some pages

The %include in the head block is in a conditional loop
  jekyll.environment == 'production'
    this is the default on github pages
    the default with jekyll serve locally is 'development'
    this prevent my dev work from being tracked by google google_analytics
