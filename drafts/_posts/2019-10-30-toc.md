## Type of Computing

We submit our job, wait, and we get an answer.  This is great when we are discovering and developing. When you trying to scale frequency, size, response time, quantity you probably want faster run times.  Faster also opens doors to more methods and approaches.  In my experience, faster breeds creativity!

To kick this blog off I want to break faster down into three types (and a few subtypes).  We will reference back to these in future post, as well as, dive deeper into them.  For the time being we will take data size and IO speed out of the conversation.  

* Scaling Out: Splitting a job into jobs
* Scaling Up: Spreading a computation over multiple threads
* Distributed Computing: Spreading a computation over multiple threads and machines
