Dear Reader,
March 8 - 11, 2020, were intended to be exciting days of collaboration and sharing at [PHUSE US Connect 2020](https://www.phuse.eu/us-connect20).  Like so many 2020 events, this one canceled due to Covid-19.  I am thankful this organization was one of the early adopters of the concept of "flattening the curve."  

With no event, the content still lives on.  In this post, I share the presentation I prepared in this open forum in hopes that I can engage you and get feedback.

Thank You,
Mike
