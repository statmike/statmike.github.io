Dear Reader,<br>
March 8 - 11, 2020, were intended to be exciting days of collaboration and sharing at [PHUSE US Connect 2020](https://www.phuse.eu/us-connect20).  Like so many 2020 events, this one canceled due to Covid-19.  I am thankful this organization was one of the early adopters of the concept of "flattening the curve."  

With no event, the content still lives on.  In this post, I share the presentation I prepared in this open forum in hopes that I can engage you and get feedback.

Thank You,<br>
Mike

## Introduction

Heads Up!  While most of my posts are on the technical side of how to do plan and do analysis and data flow, this one is about applying a new idea to a dated process. It is not yet in place, but my view is that this is a solution to an outdated method.  I welcome your feedback on what you are about to read.  The original goal was to present this at PHUSE in the hopes of getting real-time feedback.

Clinical trial monitoring that necessary yet unexciting process is the key to more efficient trials.  Efficient?  At first, efficient is just getting from the first patient to completed analysis as fast as possible.  The exciting part of efficiency is that the closer we get to real-time data monitoring, the closer we get to implementing more complex innovative trial designs.  Making decisions faster and with more accuracy is the prize at the end of the complexity.

Technology is not just a showcase of what is possible.  It is a necessity for progress.  Here we talk about software, but technology is anything developed from scientific knowledge.  Imagine that moment they first put a saddle on a horse.  It was a comfortable leap forward, but luckily improvement didn't stop before we got the train, car, plane, and rocket.  This presentation focuses on implementing newer technology to enable positive change to a tried-and-true process.
