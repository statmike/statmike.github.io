## Further Reading On This Topic

* In 2013, the FDA released guidance for industry entitled ["Oversight of Clinical Investigations - A Risk Based Approach to Monitoring"](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/oversight-clinical-investigations-risk-based-approach-monitoring).
* In 2018, the ICH GCP guidance on [Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6 R2)](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/e6r2-good-clinical-practice-integrated-addendum-ich-e6r1) was updated with inclusion on the topic of central monitoring and integrating risk-based approaches into quality management systems.  This is a unified standard for the EU, Japan, and United States.
* In 2019, the FDA released draft guidance for industry, to expand on the earlier guidance, entitled ["A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring of Clinical Investigations Questions and Answers"](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/risk-based-approach-monitoring-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers).
* The 1997 guidance [ICH E8 (R1) General Considerations For Clinical Studies](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/e8-general-considerations-clinical-trials) contains guidance on identifying factors critical to study quality.
