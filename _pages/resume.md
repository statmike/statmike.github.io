## Mike Henderson

I am a lifetime learner with a background in statistics. My passion is for quantifying the patient experience in healthcare through better drug and device evaluation in research, development, clinical, and market settings. My career started with over a decade of experience in clinical trials research covering drugs, devices and combinations with a focus on inferential methods for patient-reported outcomes, efficient trial design and conduct, and the application of Bayesian methods. I have built on this experience in a customer advisory role at SAS for the past 7 years to help life science, care provider, and healthcare companies apply analytical techniques to better understand and predict the impact of care on the patient experience.

I am fanatical about computational engineering and work tirelessly to broaden my exposure and utilization of a wide range of tools with a goal of creatively enabling deeper inferential and predictive evaluations of human data.
